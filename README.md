# Argh-steroids AI-Contest

An Asteroids AI contest using jcupitt's Argh-Steroids as the base. Ship controls have been pulled out and replaced with a command line argument for an executable to be run as a child process. This process will receive the map data via stdin and decide how to maneuver the ship via stdout.

Install [pygame](http://pygame.org) and run `main.py`.  Alternatively, there's 
a [WebGL version](http://jcupitt.github.io/argh-steroids-webgl).

# Game Features

* Asteroids bump off each other. It uses a map to make collision detection
  fast.

* Your ship has a shield and you can bump into asteroids a few times. The
  shield regenerates slowly.

* Mouse and keyboard controls.

* Vector graphics using an affine transform rather than a lot of trig
  functions. 

* Particle system for explosions.

* Small, simple code. It's only 1,200 lines for everything, it should be easy 
  to hack on.

* It's fast enough on a Raspberry-Pi 2. On my modest laptop it can animate 
  more than 200 asteroids and more than 5,000 particles at 60 fps.

# Secret keys

* Hold 'S' during level start animation to spawn extra asteroids for testing.

* Hold 'I' to see object and FPS counts.

* Press 'P' to toggle particles on and off. This can help the framerate
  on slower systems.

* Press 'N' to skip to the next level. Handy for testing. 

# TODO

* There's no sound. 

* Collision detection is just touching circles, we could look at the geometry
  as well to get pixel-perfect detection.

* Collision physics just exchanges the two velocities, we could do true
  billiard-ball collisions.

* The wrap-around is rather crude. We could draw sprites as they wrap.

* Python2 only, it would be easy to make it work with both.
